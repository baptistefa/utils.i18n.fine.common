If you are not familiar with Fine, you should stop reading **right now**! Please [get started with the main presentation](http://mouf-php.com/packages/mouf/utils.i18n.fine.translation-interface/README.md).

Language detection is a PHP internationalisation package, it depends of translation-interface package.
This package contains many class to return the selected language for internationalisation.

It's could be with :
- Browser detection,
- fix language,
- data set in session,
- a link between domain name and language
- a cascading of many solutions.
    
The language can be used to translate message in fine or whatever.

Dependencies
------------

Fine comes as a *Composer* package and requires the "Mouf" framework to run.
The first step is therefore to [install Mouf](http://www.mouf-php.com/).

Once Mouf is installed, you can process to the Fine installation.

Install Fine
--------------

At the same time please add a translation store system link utils.i18n.fine.file-translator, or another.
Edit your *composer.json* file, and add a dependency on *mouf/utils.i18n.fine.common*.

A minimal *composer.json* file might look like this:
```
	{
	    "require": {
	        "mouf/mouf": "~2.0",
	        "mouf/utils.i18n.fine.common": "4.0.*"
	    },
	    "autoload": {
	        "psr-0": {
	            "Test": "src/"
	        }
	    },
	    "minimum-stability": "dev"
	}
```
As explained above, Fine is a package of the Mouf framework. Mouf allows you (amoung other things) to visualy "build" your project's dependencies and instances.

To install the dependency, run

	php composer.phar install

This package contains
---------------------

###Installer

[The installer creates a default instance and automatically binds the translator.](doc/install.md)

###Default class

This package adds a fine cascading translator to bind many instances of `TranslatorInterface`. The first translation found is returned, also the next translation is checked.
Edit the instance in Mouf to add or change the order in cascading translator.

###Functions

There are 2 functions added to make translations easier:

- `iMsg` function: Returns the translation of the key, parameters (in option) and LanguageDetection (in option)
- `eMsg` function: Do an echo of `iMsg`

[Read the documentation to use it](doc/using.md)

###Interface

The interface `EditTranslationInterface` can be implemented to use the Mouf interface on the translator. Many new methods must be implemented to recover, save and edit a translation.
[Read the documentation](doc/implement.md)

###Trait

You can use this trait to implement some method of the interface.
